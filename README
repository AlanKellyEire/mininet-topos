Mininet topologies

1. Spine-leaf fabric 
  -To run the script:
   -Install mininet version 2.2.1rc1
   -Python 2.7
   -Start the controller 
   -Start the script by running ```sudo python spine_leaf.py <number_of_spine_switches> <number_of_leaf_switches> <controller_IP>```
   -Check the controller to make sure you see all the switches and connections 
   -Switches with prefix "S1" are Spine switches, and "L2" are leaf switches
   -Do a ```pingall``` in the mininet concole so the hosts are discovered through ARP
   -Refresh the controller UI to see the hosts

2. Fat-tree topology
